# Developer guide

This project is built in TypeScript using Projen ([projen.io](http://projen.io/)). This supports project-wide testing, code checks, and compilation. There is currently no dedicated development container, so you need to configure your local development environment by following the steps below.

The repository is organized around four main pieces:

- **Agent runtime code** in Python under `agent/` — runtime entrypoint, task execution loop, memory writes, observability hooks, and local container tooling.
- **Infrastructure as code** in AWS CDK under `src/` — stacks, constructs, and handlers that define and deploy the platform on AWS.
- **Documentation site** under `docs/` — source guides/design docs plus the generated Astro/Starlight documentation site.
- **CLI package** under `cli/` — the `bgagent` command-line client used to authenticate, submit tasks, and inspect task status/events.
