title: Repository preparation
---

The CDK stack ships with a **sample onboarded repository** (`krokoko/agent-plugins` in `src/stacks/agent.ts`) so the project deploys and CDK tests run cleanly out of the box. That value is for **default wiring only**: a real agent run **pushes branches and opens pull requests** with your GitHub PAT, so the onboarded repo must be one your token can **clone, push to, and open PRs on**. Most people do **not** have that access to the upstream repo.

**Recommended first setup:** fork [`awslabs/agent-plugins`](https://github.com/awslabs/agent-plugins) on GitHub, set the `Blueprint` **`repo`** to **`your-github-username/agent-plugins`** (match your fork’s owner and repo name), and create a **fine-grained PAT** with access **only to that fork** (clone, push, PRs—see `agent/README.md` for scopes). Use that token for **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** when running `./agent/run.sh` locally and store the same value in Secrets Manager after deploy. For use on your own codebases, point the Blueprint at those repos instead and scope the PAT to match.

Register every repo you want tasks to target and align tools and permissions (steps below).

### 1. Register repositories with `Blueprint` (required)

The Task API only accepts tasks for repositories that are **onboarded** — each one is a `Blueprint` construct in `src/stacks/agent.ts` that writes a `RepoConfig` row to DynamoDB.

1. Open **`src/stacks/agent.ts`** and locate the `Blueprint` block (for example `AgentPluginsBlueprint`).
2. Set **`repo`** to your repository in **`owner/repo`** form. For a quick end-to-end test, use your **fork** of the sample plugin repo (e.g. `jane-doe/agent-plugins` after forking `awslabs/agent-plugins`). For your own services, use something like `acme/my-service`. This must match the `repo` field users pass in the CLI or API.
3. **Multiple repositories:** add another `new Blueprint(this, 'YourBlueprintId', { repo: 'owner/other-repo', repoTable: repoTable.table, ... })` and append it to the **`blueprints`** array. That array is used to aggregate per-repo **DNS egress** allowlists; skipping it can block the agent from reaching domains your Blueprint declares.

Optional per-repo overrides (same file / `Blueprint` props) include a different AgentCore **`runtimeArn`**, **`modelId`**, **`maxTurns`**, **`systemPromptOverrides`**, or a **`githubTokenSecretArn`** for a dedicated PAT. If you use a custom `runtimeArn` or secret per repo, you must also pass the corresponding ARNs into **`TaskOrchestrator`** via **`additionalRuntimeArns`** and **`additionalSecretArns`** so the orchestrator Lambda’s IAM policy allows them (see [Repo onboarding](/design/repo-onboarding) for the full model).

After changing Blueprints, redeploy: `npx projen deploy`.

### 2. GitHub personal access token

The agent clones, pushes, and opens pull requests using a **GitHub PAT** stored in Secrets Manager (see [Post-deployment setup](#post-deployment-setup)). The token must have permission to access **every** onboarded repository (clone, push to branches, create/update PRs). Use a fine-grained PAT scoped to those repos—for the fork workflow above, restrict the token to **your fork** only; see `agent/README.md` for required scopes.

### 3. Agent image (`agent/Dockerfile`)

The default image installs Python, Node 20, `git`, `gh`, Claude Code CLI, and **`mise`** for polyglot builds. If your repositories need extra runtimes (Java, Go, specific CLIs, native libs), **extend `agent/Dockerfile`** (and optionally `agent/` tooling) so `mise run build` and your stack’s workflows succeed inside the container. Rebuild the runtime asset when you change the Dockerfile (a normal `npx projen deploy` / CDK asset build does this).

### 4. Stack name (optional)

The development stack id is set in **`src/main.ts`** (default **`backgroundagent-dev`**). If you rename it, update every place that passes **`--stack-name`** to the AWS CLI (including examples in this guide and any scripts you keep locally).

### 5. Fork-specific metadata (optional)

If you maintain your own fork, you will typically also replace **clone URLs**, **README badges**, **issue links**, and **`package.json` `name`** fields with your org’s identifiers. Those do not affect runtime behavior but avoid confusion for contributors.

### 6. Make target repositories easy for the agent

Keep each repo you onboard **clear and automatable**: documented build/test commands, consistent layout, and project-level agent hints (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`). See [Make your codebase AI ready](https://medium.com/@alain.krok/make-your-codebase-ai-ready-05d6a160f1d5) for practical guidance.
