title: Viewing logs
---

Each task record includes a `logs_url` field with a direct link to filtered CloudWatch logs. You can get this URL from the task status output or from the `GET /tasks/{task_id}` API response.

Alternatively, the application logs are in the CloudWatch log group:

```
/aws/vendedlogs/bedrock-agentcore/runtime/APPLICATION_LOGS/jean_cloude
```

Filter by task ID to find logs for a specific task.
