# ABCA Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that provides guided workflows for setting up, deploying, operating, and troubleshooting the ABCA (Autonomous Background Coding Agents on AWS) platform.

## Installation

```bash
claude --plugin-dir docs/abca-plugin
```

Or add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["./docs/abca-plugin"]
}
```

## What's Included

### Skills (slash commands)

| Skill | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time setup, prerequisites | Walk through prerequisites, toolchain, and first deployment |
| `/deploy` | Deploy, diff, destroy | Deploy, diff, or destroy the CDK stack |
| `/onboard-repo` | Add a repository | Onboard a GitHub repo via Blueprint CDK construct |
| `/submit-task` | Submit a coding task | Submit tasks with prompt quality guidance and cost controls (supports quick mode) |
| `/troubleshoot` | Debug, errors, failures | Diagnose build, deployment, auth, and task execution issues |
| `/status` | Status, health check | Check stack health, running tasks, and recent history |

### Agents

| Agent | Model | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `cdk-expert` | Sonnet | AWS CDK infrastructure expert for construct design, handler implementation, and stack modifications |
| `agent-debugger` | Sonnet | Read-only debugging specialist for task failures, preflight errors, and CloudWatch log analysis |

### Hook

- **SessionStart** — Advertises available skills and agents so Claude can proactively suggest them when your request matches.

## Testing

This plugin is markdown and configuration only (no executable code), so traditional unit tests don't apply. Instead, a **3-layer validation strategy** verifies correctness:

| Layer | What it checks |
|-------|---------------|
| **1. Structural** | `plugin.json` fields, file discovery, JSON/YAML validity, no orphaned files |
| **2. Agent Config** | Frontmatter fields (`model`, `tools`, `description`), valid tool names, file path accuracy, capability alignment with examples |
| **3. Content Integrity** | All repo paths exist, all `mise run` commands are valid tasks, all `bgagent` CLI flags match actual help output, skill cross-references resolve, AWS CLI syntax is correct |

### Running the tests

From the repo root with Claude Code:

```
claude --plugin-dir docs/abca-plugin
```

Then ask Claude to validate the plugin:

```
Validate the abca-plugin using the plugin-validator agent, then verify
all command references and file paths in the skills are accurate.
```

Or run the checks manually:

```bash
# Layer 1: Structural — valid JSON
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('docs/abca-plugin/plugin.json')); print('plugin.json OK')"

# Layer 3: Content — mise tasks exist
MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 mise tasks --all 2>/dev/null | grep -E '(build|install|compile|test|deploy|destroy|diff|synth|bootstrap)'

# Layer 3: Content — CLI flags match
node cli/lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --help && node cli/lib/bin/bgagent.js list --help
```

## Development

To modify the plugin:

1. Edit the relevant `.md` file under `skills/` or `agents/`
2. Re-validate using the testing strategy above
3. Ensure any new file paths or commands you reference actually exist in the repo
