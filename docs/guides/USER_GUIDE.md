# User guide

This guide covers how to use ABCA to submit coding tasks and monitor their progress.

## Overview

ABCA is a platform for running autonomous background coding agents on AWS. You submit a task (a GitHub repository + a task description or issue number), an agent works autonomously in an isolated environment, and delivers a pull request when done.

There are three ways to interact with the platform:

1. **CLI** (recommended) — The `bgagent` CLI authenticates via Cognito and calls the Task API. Handles login, token caching, and output formatting.
2. **REST API** (direct) — Call the Task API endpoints directly with a JWT token. Full validation, audit logging, and idempotency support.
3. **Webhook** — External systems (CI pipelines, GitHub Actions) can create tasks via HMAC-authenticated HTTP requests. No Cognito credentials needed; uses a shared secret per integration.

## Prerequisites

- The CDK stack deployed (see [Developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md))
- A Cognito user account (see [Authentication](#authentication) below)
- **Repositories must be onboarded** before tasks can target them (see [Repository onboarding](#repository-onboarding) below)
- For the **CLI**: Node.js installed; build the CLI with `cd cli && mise run build`

## Authentication

The Task API uses Amazon Cognito for authentication. Self-signup is disabled; an administrator must create your account.

### Get stack outputs

After deployment, retrieve the API URL and Cognito identifiers. Set `REGION` to the AWS region where you deployed the stack (for example `us-east-1`). Use the same value for all `aws` and `bgagent configure` commands below — a mismatch often surfaces as a confusing Cognito “app client does not exist” error.

```bash
REGION=<your-deployment-region>

API_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`ApiUrl`].OutputValue' --output text)
USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' --output text)
APP_CLIENT_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`AppClientId`].OutputValue' --output text)
```

### Create a user (admin)

```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID \
  --username user@example.com \
  --temporary-password 'TempPass123!@'

aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID \
  --username user@example.com \
  --password 'YourPerm@nent1Pass!' \
  --permanent
```

Password requirements: minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.

### Obtain a JWT token

```bash
TOKEN=$(aws cognito-idp initiate-auth \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --client-id $APP_CLIENT_ID \
  --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH \
  --auth-parameters USERNAME=user@example.com,PASSWORD='YourPerm@nent1Pass!' \
  --query 'AuthenticationResult.IdToken' --output text)
```

Use this token in the `Authorization` header for all API requests.

## Repository onboarding

Before submitting tasks against a repository, the repository must be **onboarded** to the platform. Onboarding is managed by the platform administrator through CDK — each repository is registered as a `Blueprint` construct in the CDK stack, which writes a configuration record to the `RepoTable` DynamoDB table.

If you submit a task against a repository that has not been onboarded, the API returns a `422` error with code `REPO_NOT_ONBOARDED`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "REPO_NOT_ONBOARDED",
    "message": "Repository 'owner/repo' is not onboarded. Register it with a Blueprint before submitting tasks."
  }
}
```

Contact your platform administrator to onboard a new repository. For details on how administrators register repositories, see the [Developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#repository-onboarding).

### Per-repo configuration

Blueprints can configure per-repository settings that override platform defaults:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `compute_type` | Compute strategy (`agentcore` or `ecs`) | `agentcore` |
| `runtime_arn` | AgentCore runtime ARN override | Platform default |
| `model_id` | Foundation model ID | Platform default |
| `max_turns` | Default turn limit for tasks | 100 |
| `max_budget_usd` | Default cost budget in USD per task | None (unlimited) |
| `system_prompt_overrides` | Additional system prompt instructions | None |
| `github_token_secret_arn` | Per-repo GitHub token (Secrets Manager ARN) | Platform default |
| `poll_interval_ms` | Poll interval for awaiting completion (5000–300000) | 30000 |

When you specify `--max-turns` (CLI) or `max_turns` (API) on a task, your value takes precedence over the Blueprint default. If neither is specified, the platform default (100) is used. The same override pattern applies to `--max-budget` / `max_budget_usd`, except there is no platform default — if neither the task nor the Blueprint specifies a budget, no cost limit is applied.

## Using the REST API

The Task API exposes 5 endpoints under the base URL from the `ApiUrl` stack output.

### Task types

The platform supports three task types:

| Type | Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `new_task` (default) | Create a new branch, implement changes, and open a new PR. | New pull request |
| `pr_iteration` | Check out an existing PR's branch, read review feedback, address it, and push updates. | Updated pull request |
| `pr_review` | Check out an existing PR's branch, analyze the changes read-only, and post a structured review. | Review comments on the PR |

### Create a task

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo": "owner/repo",
    "task_description": "Add input validation to the /users POST endpoint"
  }'
```

**Example response** right after submit (`status` is `SUBMITTED`; `branch_name` is reserved up front; `session_id`, `pr_url`, cost, and timing stay `null` until the orchestrator and agent progress):

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "krokoko/agent-plugins", "task_description": "add codeowners field to RFC issue template"}'
```

```json
{"data":{"task_id":"01KN36YGQV6BEPDD7CVMKP1PF3","status":"SUBMITTED","repo":"krokoko/agent-plugins","issue_number":null,"task_description":"add codeowners field to RFC issue template","branch_name":"bgagent/01KN36YGQV6BEPDD7CVMKP1PF3/add-codeowners-field-to-rfc-issue-template","session_id":null,"pr_url":null,"error_message":null,"created_at":"2026-04-01T00:26:30.011Z","updated_at":"2026-04-01T00:26:30.011Z","started_at":null,"completed_at":null,"duration_s":null,"cost_usd":null,"build_passed":null,"max_turns":null,"max_budget_usd":null,"prompt_version":null}}
```

To create a task from a GitHub issue:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "owner/repo", "issue_number": 42}'
```

To iterate on an existing pull request (address review feedback):

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "owner/repo", "task_type": "pr_iteration", "pr_number": 42}'
```

You can optionally include `task_description` with `pr_iteration` to provide additional instructions alongside the review feedback:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "owner/repo", "task_type": "pr_iteration", "pr_number": 42, "task_description": "Focus on the null check Alice flagged in the auth module"}'
```

To request a read-only review of an existing pull request:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "owner/repo", "task_type": "pr_review", "pr_number": 55}'
```

You can optionally include `task_description` with `pr_review` to focus the review on specific areas:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repo": "owner/repo", "task_type": "pr_review", "pr_number": 55, "task_description": "Focus on security implications and error handling"}'
```

**Request body fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repo` | string | Yes | GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format |
| `issue_number` | number | One of these | GitHub issue number |
| `task_description` | string | is required | Free-text task description |
| `pr_number` | number | | PR number to iterate on or review (required for `pr_iteration` and `pr_review`) |
| `task_type` | string | No | `new_task` (default), `pr_iteration`, or `pr_review`. |
| `max_turns` | number | No | Maximum agent turns (1–500). Overrides the per-repo Blueprint default. Platform default: 100. |
| `max_budget_usd` | number | No | Maximum cost budget in USD (0.01–100). When reached, the agent stops regardless of remaining turns. Overrides the per-repo Blueprint default. If omitted, no budget limit is applied. |

**Content screening:** Task descriptions are automatically screened by Amazon Bedrock Guardrails for prompt injection before the task is created. If content is blocked, you receive a `400 GUARDRAIL_BLOCKED` error — revise the description and retry. If the screening service is temporarily unavailable, you receive a `503` error — retry after a short delay. For PR tasks (`pr_iteration`, `pr_review`), the assembled prompt (including PR body and review comments) is also screened during context hydration; if blocked, the task transitions to `FAILED`.

**Idempotency:** Include an `Idempotency-Key` header (alphanumeric, dashes, underscores, max 128 chars) to prevent duplicate task creation on retries:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: my-unique-key-123" \
  -d '{"repo": "owner/repo", "task_description": "Fix bug"}'
```

### List tasks

```bash
curl "$API_URL/tasks" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | Filter by status (e.g., `RUNNING` or `RUNNING,SUBMITTED`) |
| `repo` | Filter by repository |
| `limit` | Max results per page (default: 20, max: 100) |
| `next_token` | Pagination token from a previous response |

Example with filters:

```bash
curl "$API_URL/tasks?status=RUNNING,SUBMITTED&limit=10" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

### Get task detail

```bash
curl "$API_URL/tasks/<TASK_ID>" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
curl "$API_URL/tasks/01KJDSS94G3VA55CW1M534EC7Q" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

Returns the full task record including status, timestamps, PR URL, cost, and error details.

**Example** (after a successful run — `status` is `COMPLETED`, `pr_url` populated):

```bash
curl "$API_URL/tasks/01KN36YGQV6BEPDD7CVMKP1PF3" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

```json
{"data":{"task_id":"01KN36YGQV6BEPDD7CVMKP1PF3","status":"COMPLETED","repo":"krokoko/agent-plugins","issue_number":null,"task_description":"add codeowners field to RFC issue template","branch_name":"bgagent/01KN36YGQV6BEPDD7CVMKP1PF3/add-codeowners-field-to-rfc-issue-template","session_id":"3eb8f3fb-808d-47d6-8557-309fb9369ea7","pr_url":"https://github.com/krokoko/agent-plugins/pull/59","error_message":null,"created_at":"2026-04-01T00:26:30.011Z","updated_at":"2026-04-01T00:26:35.350Z","started_at":"2026-04-01T00:26:35.350Z","completed_at":"2026-04-01T00:30:32Z","duration_s":"125.9","cost_usd":"0.15938219999999997","build_passed":null,"max_turns":null,"max_budget_usd":null,"prompt_version":"1c9c10e027a2"}}
```

### Cancel a task

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$API_URL/tasks/<TASK_ID>" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

Transitions the task to `CANCELLED` and records a cancellation event. Only tasks in non-terminal states can be cancelled.

### Get task events (audit log)

```bash
curl "$API_URL/tasks/<TASK_ID>/events" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

Returns the chronological event log for a task (e.g., `task_created`, `preflight_failed`, `session_started`, `task_completed`). Supports `limit` and `next_token` pagination parameters. If the task failed before the agent ran, inspect `preflight_failed` entries for `reason` and `detail` (see **Task events** under **Task lifecycle**).

## Using the CLI

The `bgagent` CLI is the recommended way to interact with the platform. It authenticates via Cognito, manages token caching, and provides formatted output.

**This repository** builds the CLI under `cli/`; after compile, run the entrypoint as `node lib/bin/bgagent.js` from the `cli` directory (the path `package.json` exposes as `bin`). If you install a published package or link `bgagent` onto your `PATH`, you can call `bgagent` directly — the subcommands are the same.

### Setup

```bash
cd cli
mise run build

# Configure with your stack outputs (run from cli/)
node lib/bin/bgagent.js configure \
  --api-url $API_URL \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID \
  --client-id $APP_CLIENT_ID

# Log in
node lib/bin/bgagent.js login --username user@example.com
```

### Submitting a task

```bash
# From cli/ — from a GitHub issue
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --issue 42

# From a text description
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --task "Add input validation to the /users POST endpoint"

# Iterate on an existing pull request (address review feedback)
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --pr 42

# Iterate on a PR with additional instructions
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --pr 42 --task "Focus on the null check Alice flagged"

# Review an existing pull request (read-only — posts structured review comments)
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --review-pr 55

# Review a PR with a specific focus area
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --review-pr 55 --task "Focus on security and error handling"

# Submit and wait for completion
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo owner/repo --issue 42 --wait
```

**Example** (default `text` output immediately after a successful submit — task is `SUBMITTED`, branch name reserved):

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit --repo krokoko/agent-plugins --task "add codeowners field to RFC issue template"
```

```text
Task:        01KN37PZ77P1W19D71DTZ15X6X
Status:      SUBMITTED
Repo:        krokoko/agent-plugins
Description: add codeowners field to RFC issue template
Branch:      bgagent/01KN37PZ77P1W19D71DTZ15X6X/add-codeowners-field-to-rfc-issue-template
Created:     2026-04-01T00:39:51.271Z
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo` | GitHub repository (`owner/repo`). Required. |
| `--issue` | GitHub issue number. |
| `--task` | Task description text. |
| `--pr` | PR number to iterate on. Sets task type to `pr_iteration`. The agent checks out the PR's branch, reads review feedback, and pushes updates. |
| `--review-pr` | PR number to review. Sets task type to `pr_review`. The agent checks out the PR's branch, analyzes changes read-only, and posts structured review comments. |
| `--max-turns` | Maximum agent turns (1–500). Overrides per-repo Blueprint default. Platform default: 100. |
| `--max-budget` | Maximum cost budget in USD (0.01–100). Overrides per-repo Blueprint default. No default limit. |
| `--idempotency-key` | Idempotency key for deduplication. |
| `--wait` | Poll until the task reaches a terminal status. |
| `--output` | Output format: `text` (default) or `json`. |

At least one of `--issue`, `--task`, `--pr`, or `--review-pr` is required. The `--pr` and `--review-pr` flags are mutually exclusive.

### Checking task status

Run these from the `cli/` directory (same as in **Setup**).

#### Single task

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js status <TASK_ID>

# Poll until completion
node lib/bin/bgagent.js status <TASK_ID> --wait
```

**Example** (default `text` output once the task has finished — `COMPLETED`, with session id, PR link, duration, and cost):

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js status 01KN37PZ77P1W19D71DTZ15X6X
```

```text
Task:        01KN37PZ77P1W19D71DTZ15X6X
Status:      COMPLETED
Repo:        krokoko/agent-plugins

#### All tasks

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js list
node lib/bin/bgagent.js list --status RUNNING,SUBMITTED
node lib/bin/bgagent.js list --repo owner/repo --limit 10
```

### Viewing task events

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js events <TASK_ID>
node lib/bin/bgagent.js events <TASK_ID> --limit 20
node lib/bin/bgagent.js events <TASK_ID> --output json
```

Use **`--output json`** to see the full payload for **`preflight_failed`** (`reason`, `detail`, and per-check metadata). See **Task events** under **Task lifecycle** for how to interpret common `reason` values.

### Cancelling a task

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js cancel <TASK_ID>
```

## Webhook integration

Webhooks allow external systems (CI pipelines, GitHub Actions, custom automation) to create tasks without Cognito credentials. Each webhook integration has its own HMAC-SHA256 shared secret.

### Managing webhooks

Webhook management requires Cognito authentication (same as the REST API).

#### Create a webhook

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My CI Pipeline"}'
```

The response includes a `secret` field — **store it securely, it is only shown once**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "webhook_id": "01HYX...",
    "name": "My CI Pipeline",
    "secret": "<webhook-secret-64-hex-characters>",
    "created_at": "2025-03-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

Webhook names must be 1-64 characters: alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens, or underscores, starting and ending with an alphanumeric character.

#### List webhooks

```bash
curl "$API_URL/webhooks" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

By default, revoked webhooks are excluded. To include them:

```bash
curl "$API_URL/webhooks?include_revoked=true" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

Supports `limit` and `next_token` pagination parameters.

#### Revoke a webhook

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$API_URL/webhooks/<WEBHOOK_ID>" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

Revocation is a soft delete: the webhook record is marked `revoked` and the secret is scheduled for deletion (7-day recovery window). Revoked webhooks can no longer authenticate requests. Revoked webhook records are automatically deleted from DynamoDB after 30 days (configurable via `webhookRetentionDays`).

### Submitting tasks via webhook

Use the webhook endpoint with HMAC-SHA256 authentication instead of a JWT:

```bash
WEBHOOK_ID="01HYX..."
WEBHOOK_SECRET="a1b2c3d4..."
BODY='{"repo": "owner/repo", "task_description": "Fix the login bug"}'

# Compute HMAC-SHA256 signature
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$WEBHOOK_SECRET" | cut -d' ' -f2)

curl -X POST "$API_URL/webhooks/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Id: $WEBHOOK_ID" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=$SIGNATURE" \
  -d "$BODY"
```

The request body is identical to `POST /v1/tasks` (same `repo`, `issue_number`, `task_description`, `task_type`, `pr_number`, `max_turns`, `max_budget_usd` fields). The `Idempotency-Key` header is also supported. You can submit `pr_iteration` tasks via webhook to automate PR feedback loops, or `pr_review` tasks to trigger automated code reviews.

**Example response** (same shape as a successful `POST /tasks` — `status` is `SUBMITTED`; session, PR, and cost fields are `null` until the run progresses):

```json
{"data":{"task_id":"01KN38AB1SE79QA4MBNAHFBQAN","status":"SUBMITTED","repo":"krokoko/agent-plugins","issue_number":null,"task_description":"add codeowners field to RFC issue template","branch_name":"bgagent/01KN38AB1SE79QA4MBNAHFBQAN/add-codeowners-field-to-rfc-issue-template","session_id":null,"pr_url":null,"error_message":null,"created_at":"2026-04-01T00:50:25.977Z","updated_at":"2026-04-01T00:50:25.977Z","started_at":null,"completed_at":null,"duration_s":null,"cost_usd":null,"build_passed":null,"max_turns":null,"max_budget_usd":null,"prompt_version":null}}
```

**Required headers:**

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `X-Webhook-Id` | The webhook integration ID |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | `sha256=` followed by the hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using the webhook secret |

Tasks created via webhook are owned by the Cognito user who created the webhook integration. They appear in that user's task list and can be managed (status, cancel, events) through the normal REST API or CLI.

### Webhook authentication flow

1. The caller sends `POST /v1/webhooks/tasks` with `X-Webhook-Id` and `X-Webhook-Signature` headers.
2. A Lambda REQUEST authorizer extracts the `X-Webhook-Id` header, looks up the webhook record in DynamoDB, and verifies `status: active`. On success it returns an Allow policy with `context: { userId, webhookId }`.
3. The webhook handler fetches the shared secret from Secrets Manager (cached in-memory with a 5-minute TTL).
4. The handler computes `HMAC-SHA256(secret, request_body)` and performs a constant-time comparison with the provided signature.
5. On success, the task is created under the webhook owner's identity. On failure, a `401 Unauthorized` response is returned.

**Note:** HMAC verification is performed by the handler (not the authorizer) because API Gateway REST API v1 does not pass the request body to Lambda REQUEST authorizers. Authorizer result caching is disabled (`resultsCacheTtl: 0`) because each request has a unique signature.

## Task lifecycle

When you create a task via the REST API, the platform automatically orchestrates it through these states:

```
SUBMITTED ──> HYDRATING ──> RUNNING ──> COMPLETED
    │              │           │
    │              │           └──> FAILED / CANCELLED / TIMED_OUT
    │              └──> FAILED / CANCELLED
    └──> FAILED / CANCELLED
```

The orchestrator uses Lambda Durable Functions to manage the lifecycle durably — long-running tasks (up to 9 hours) survive transient failures and Lambda timeouts. The agent commits work regularly, so partial progress is never lost.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SUBMITTED` | Task accepted; orchestrator invoked asynchronously |
| `HYDRATING` | Orchestrator passed admission control; assembling the agent payload |
| `RUNNING` | Agent session started and actively working on the task |
| `COMPLETED` | Agent finished and created a PR (or determined no changes were needed) |
| `FAILED` | Agent encountered an error, user concurrency limit was reached, content was blocked by guardrail screening, or **pre-flight** checks failed before the agent started (for example an underpowered GitHub PAT) |
| `CANCELLED` | Task was cancelled by the user |
| `TIMED_OUT` | Task exceeded the maximum allowed duration (~9 hours) |

Terminal states: `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `TIMED_OUT`.

**Data retention:** Task records in terminal states are automatically deleted from DynamoDB after 90 days (configurable via `taskRetentionDays`). Querying a task after this period returns a `404`. Active tasks are not affected.

### Concurrency limits

Each user can have up to **3 tasks running concurrently** by default (configurable via the `maxConcurrentTasksPerUser` prop on the `TaskOrchestrator` CDK construct). If you exceed the limit, the task transitions to `FAILED` with a concurrency limit message. Wait for an active task to complete, or cancel one, then retry.

There is currently no system-wide concurrency cap — the theoretical maximum across all users is `number_of_users * per_user_limit`. The hard ceiling is the AgentCore concurrent sessions quota for your AWS account, which is an account-level service limit. Check the [AWS Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) for Bedrock AgentCore in your region to see the current value. The `InvokeAgentRuntime` API is also rate-limited to 25 TPS per agent per account (adjustable via Service Quotas).

### Task events

Each lifecycle transition is recorded as an audit event. Use the events endpoint to see the full history:

```bash
curl "$API_URL/tasks/<TASK_ID>/events" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

Events include: `task_created`, `admission_rejected`, `preflight_failed`, `hydration_started`, `hydration_complete`, `guardrail_blocked`, `session_started`, `pr_created`, `pr_updated`, `task_completed`, `task_failed`, `task_cancelled`, `task_timed_out`. Event records are subject to the same 90-day retention as task records and are automatically deleted after that period.

**`preflight_failed`:** The orchestrator could not safely start work (GitHub API checks run **before** hydration and AgentCore). Open the event in `bgagent events <TASK_ID>` (or the JSON from `GET /tasks/{id}/events`) and read **`reason`** and **`detail`**. Typical values for **`reason`** include `GITHUB_UNREACHABLE`, `REPO_NOT_FOUND_OR_NO_ACCESS`, `INSUFFICIENT_GITHUB_REPO_PERMISSIONS`, and `PR_NOT_FOUND_OR_CLOSED`. The most common fix for **`INSUFFICIENT_GITHUB_REPO_PERMISSIONS`** is to update the GitHub PAT in AWS Secrets Manager so it matches your task type—for **`new_task`** / **`pr_iteration`** you need **Contents** read/write and **Pull requests** read/write on the target repo; **`pr_review`** can pass with **Triage** (or higher) when you do not need to push. See [Developer guide — Repository preparation](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#repository-preparation) for the full table and `put-secret-value` steps.

## What the agent does

### New task (`new_task`)

When a `new_task` is submitted, the agent:

1. Clones the repository into an isolated workspace
2. Creates a branch named `bgagent/<task-id>/<short-description>`
3. Installs dependencies via `mise install` and runs an initial build
4. Loads repo-level project configuration (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` settings, agents, rules, `.mcp.json`) if present
5. Reads the codebase to understand the project structure
6. Makes the requested changes
7. Runs the build and tests (`mise run build`)
8. Commits and pushes incrementally throughout
9. Creates a pull request with a summary of changes, build/test results, and decisions made

The PR title follows conventional commit format (e.g., `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow`).

### PR iteration (`pr_iteration`)

When a `pr_iteration` task is submitted, the agent:

1. Clones the repository into an isolated workspace
2. Checks out the existing PR branch (fetched from the remote)
3. Installs dependencies via `mise install` and runs an initial build
4. Loads repo-level project configuration if present
5. Reads the review feedback (inline comments, conversation comments, and the PR diff)
6. Addresses the feedback with focused changes
7. Runs the build and tests (`mise run build`)
8. Commits and pushes to the existing PR branch
9. Posts a summary comment on the PR describing what was addressed

The agent does **not** create a new PR — it updates the existing one in place. The PR's branch, title, and description remain unchanged; the agent adds commits and a comment summarizing its work.

### PR review (`pr_review`)

When a `pr_review` task is submitted, the agent:

1. Clones the repository into an isolated workspace
2. Checks out the existing PR branch (fetched from the remote)
3. Installs dependencies via `mise install` and runs an initial build (informational only — build failures do not block the review)
4. Loads repo-level project configuration if present
5. Reads the PR context (diff, description, existing comments) and analyzes the changes
6. Leverages repository memory context (codebase patterns, past episodes) when available
7. Composes structured findings using a defined comment format: type (comment / question / issue / good_point), severity for issues (minor / medium / major / critical), title, description, proposed fix, and a ready-to-use AI prompt for addressing each finding
8. Posts the review via the GitHub Reviews API (`gh api repos/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews`) as a single batch review
9. Posts a summary conversation comment on the PR

The agent operates in **read-only mode** — it does not modify any files, create commits, or push changes. The `Write` and `Edit` tools are not available during `pr_review` tasks.

## Viewing logs

Each task record includes a `logs_url` field with a direct link to filtered CloudWatch logs. You can get this URL from the task status output or from the `GET /tasks/{task_id}` API response.

Alternatively, the application logs are in the CloudWatch log group:

```
/aws/vendedlogs/bedrock-agentcore/runtime/APPLICATION_LOGS/jean_cloude
```

Filter by task ID to find logs for a specific task.

## Tips

- **Onboard your repo first**: Repositories must be registered via a `Blueprint` construct before tasks can target them. If you get a `REPO_NOT_ONBOARDED` error, contact your platform administrator.
- **GitHub PAT and `preflight_failed`**: If a task ends in `FAILED` with a `preflight_failed` event, the platform rejected the run before the agent consumed compute—often a token scoped read-only while the task needed push access. Check event `reason` / `detail` and align your fine-grained PAT with [Repository preparation](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#repository-preparation); then update the secret and submit a new task.
- **Prepare your repo**: The agent works best with repositories that are agent friendly. See the [Developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for repository preparation advice.
- **Add a CLAUDE.md**: The agent automatically loads project-level configuration from your repository — `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/`, and `.mcp.json`. Use these to provide project-specific build commands, conventions, constraints, custom subagents, and architecture notes. See the [Prompt guide](./PROMPT_GUIDE.md#repo-level-customization) for details and examples.
- **Issue vs text**: When using `--issue` (CLI) or `issue_number` (API), the agent fetches the full issue body from GitHub, including any labels, comments, and linked context. This is usually better than a short text description.
- **Cost**: Cost depends on the model and number of turns. Use `--max-turns` (CLI) or `max_turns` (API) to cap the number of agent iterations per task (range: 1–500). If not specified, the per-repo Blueprint default applies, falling back to the platform default (100). Use `--max-budget` (CLI) or `max_budget_usd` (API) to set a hard cost limit in USD ($0.01–$100) — when the budget is reached, the agent stops regardless of remaining turns. If no budget is specified, the per-repo Blueprint default applies; if that is also absent, no cost limit is enforced. Check the task status after completion to see the reported cost.
- **Content screening**: Task descriptions and PR context are screened by Bedrock Guardrails for prompt injection. If your task is unexpectedly blocked, check the task events (`guardrail_blocked`) for details and revise your description.
- **Idempotency**: Use the `Idempotency-Key` header when creating tasks via the API to safely retry requests without creating duplicate tasks.
